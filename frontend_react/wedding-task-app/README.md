# Our Big Day

# Front End

Javascript and React

# Back End

Ruby on Rails and Postgresql database

# Theme

A simple To-do / Task management app. Because I am getting married next April, I wanted to create an app that would help my fianc√©e and myself in task management.

# Purpose / Learning Outcomes

I wanted to create a simple weekend project where I can test Rails and React together. Using Rails as the backend with Postgresql as the database, and JavaScript and React as the front end.

Another learning outcome was getting the Rails server to work on my laptop (ubuntu) and connect the front end React from my Desktop (windows 10), while on the same network.

# Functionality and Features

Currently it's a very simple interface with a single form entry that stores to the backend database. Eventually I want to include separate tabs ie (photography services, florist information, guests invited and contact details, invitation stock)
